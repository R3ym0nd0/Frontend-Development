# Website Portfolio v0.0.1

Welcome to the first version of my Website portfolio!  
This project is part of my journey as an aspiring Web Penetration Tester who’s currently exploring front-end development to better understand how websites are built.

## 📌 Current Status

- ✅ Introduction/Home section design is complete  
- 🟡 Navbar sections (`About Me`, `Skills`, `Projects`) are present, but not functional yet  
- ❌ Not responsive (yet)

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this version was to get the **design of the Home section done** and have a basic layout structure in place. While other sections are still empty and unresponsive, this is a small but meaningful step in building the full version of my portfolio.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML
- CSS (Vanilla, no frameworks)

## 🚧 Limitations

- Only the "Home" section is complete
- Not mobile-friendly/responsive
- Other sections are just placeholders for now
- No interactivity yet

## 🙌 Why I'm Building This

Although I’m not pursuing web development as a career, having frontend skill helps me in my main goal to become a professional Web Penetration Tester. By understanding how websites are structured, I can better find and exploit vulnerabilities during tests.
