# Website Portfolio v0.1.0

Welcome to version 0.1.0 of my personal website portfolio!  
This is part of my ongoing journey as an aspiring **Web Penetration Tester** who’s diving deeper into front-end development to better understand how websites are built, styled, and function on different devices.

## 📌 Current Status

- ✅ Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Functional hamburger menu for mobile navigation
- ✅ New "Story" section added (replaces the old About Me section)
- ✅ Code is now cleaner, more structured, and avoids overly specific selectors
- 🟡 "Read My Full Story" button is present but not functional yet
- 🟡 Only works correctly in **Google Chrome** and **Firefox**
- ❌ Skills and Projects sections are still not built

## 🎯 Goal

The goal for v0.1.0 is to:
- Add responsive design for a better user experience across all screen sizes
- Improve code structure and maintainability
- Start adding interactivity via JavaScript
- Replace the **"About Me"** section with a more personal **"Story"** section

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML
- CSS (Vanilla)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
  
---

## 🚧 Limitations

- "Skills" and "Projects" sections are still placeholders
- "Read My Full Story" button in **STORY Section** still not working
- Website rendering is buggy in browsers like **Microsoft Edge** and **Facebook in-app browser**

## 🙌 Why I'm Building This

Although I’m not pursuing web development as a career, having frontend skill helps me in my main goal to become a professional Web Penetration Tester. By understanding how websites are structured, I can better find and exploit vulnerabilities during tests.
