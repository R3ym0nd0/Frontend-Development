# ðŸ–¼ Display

- `block` - **element takes up full width and moves to next line (h1, div, p, form, header, footer)**
- `inline` - **element only takes as much space as it needs, stays in line (span, a, img)**
- `inline-block` - **element stays in line but you can size it like a block**
  
      .display {
          display: block;        /* Takes full width, starts on a new line */
          display: inline;       /* Takes only needed width, stays on the same line */
          display: inline-block; /* Like inline but you can set width and height */
      }
