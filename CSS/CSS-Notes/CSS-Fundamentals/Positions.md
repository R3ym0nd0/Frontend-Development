# ðŸ“Œ Positions

- `static`   - **default / it sits where the document flow puts it**
- `relative` - **keeps its spot but can be moved with top/left/right/bottom**
- `absolute` - **taken out of flow, it positioned by top/left/right/bottom inside nearest positioned parent**
- `fixed`    - **fixed to the screen, it stays visible while you scroll**
- `sticky`   - **normal at first, then sticks when you scroll past it**
- `top/right/bottom/left` â€“ **how far to move from that edge**
- `z-index` â€“ **which layer is on top (higher = closer to the viewer)**

          position: static;   /* default / follows normal flow */
          position: relative; /* stays in flow, but you can nudge it with top/leftâ€¦ */
          position: absolute; /* taken out of flow, placed at exact coords inside nearest positioned parent */
          position: fixed;    /* sticks to viewport, it doesnâ€™t move when you scroll */
